# RAILWAY-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM

## Introduction
The Railway Management System project was chosen to explore various concepts of data structures and algorithms. It serves as a real-time project for the convenience of travelers and passengers, utilizing the C++ programming language to develop a railway management system.

## Objectives
- Explore and display stored information efficiently.
- Utilize vectors to assemble a train from different coaches.
- Implement maps (int to string) to map stations to locations.
- Use graphs to assemble routes for the train.
- Utilize file handling to store train information in a text file.
- Implement concepts of linked lists, vectors, and graphs, incorporating knowledge of different algorithms.

## Approach

### Project Conception and Initiation
The project aimed to leverage data structures learned throughout the course curriculum, applying them to railway management. Railways play a crucial role in transportation, making it imperative to streamline usage.

### Project Definition and Planning
Defined project scope included the utilization of vectors, graphs, and file handling, with a focus on graph traversal concepts.

### Project Launch and Execution
Launch involved debugging codeblocks and adapting to different file formats for seamless execution.

## Conclusion
The project includes various functions:
- Searching for trains by Train ID or source and destination stations.
- Displaying train details.
- Adding paths between two locations.
- Checking for all available routes.
The project holds potential for real-world scenarios, aiding organizations like IRCTC in maintaining and tracking records for future use.

## Future Work
- Implement weighted graphs to find the shortest routes between stations.
- Incorporate boolean arrays to manage seat availability and bookings.
- Utilize N-Array Trees for birth allotment structure.
- Implement Doubly Linked Lists for connecting train coaches upon further division.
